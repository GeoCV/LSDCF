# LSDCF
Learning Low-rank and Sparse Discriminative Correlation Filters for Coarse-to-Fine Visual Object Tracking

## Instruction for LSDCF Tracker:
We use HOG [1][2], CN [3], and ResNet-50 [4][5] as our features. 
Code modules refer to ECO [6] in feature extraction.

### Dependencies:
MatConvNet [7], PDollar Toolbox [8], mtimesx and mexResize. 

## Installation and Run:
1. Run install.m file to compile the libraries.
2. Run demo_LSDCF_single to illustrate selected sequences.
Copy the tracker_LSDCF.m to the vot-workspace. (replace #LOCATION with the path of this folder)

### Operating system:
Successfully passed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Matlab R2018a, CPU Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5-2643 
and Windows10 MATLAB 2016a, Inteli5 2.50GHz CPU, GTX 960 GPU
